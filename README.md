# Train-Schedule

This app shows users a live train schedule.  Train routes and frequencies are stored in Firebase, and live schedules are calculated using Moment.JS.

The user can add new train routes via a form on the page.  The form updates the Firebase database, and the page is updated live with the new routes.

The app features a Bootstrap CSS layout, and uses JQuery to handle click events and element updates.
